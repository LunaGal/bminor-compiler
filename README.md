# B-Minor Compiler

B-Minor is a simple programming language specified in the book Introduction to Compilers and Language design by Douglas Thain. I will create a scanner to correctly tokenize B Minor. Then, I will write a parser to process tokens and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree to represent the structure of a B Minor program and check that it is syntactically valid. If time permits, I will write semantic routines to process the AST and write LLVM-IR that can be compiled to source files using the LLVM toolchain.
